580774	[sound:580774.mp3]	I'm a man.
241003	[sound:241003.mp3]	Think about it.
3374177	[sound:3374177.mp3]	I lied about it.
2235698	[sound:2235698.mp3]	Forget about Tom.
2549643	[sound:2549643.mp3]	I'm about done.

591205	[sound:591205.mp3]	Stay at home.
2240807	[sound:2240807.mp3]	We're at war.
3154682	[sound:3154682.mp3]	We eat at six.
1937402	[sound:1937402.mp3]	Look at that!
71962	[sound:71962.mp3]	He shot at me.
262412	[sound:262412.mp3]	Look at me.
1891024	[sound:1891024.mp3]	I'm mad at you.
5840514	[sound:5840514.mp3]	I smiled at Tom.
1501	[sound:1501.mp3]	It can't be!
2247676	[sound:2247676.mp3]	I'll be OK.
390924	[sound:390924.mp3]	Don't be shy.
1096441	[sound:1096441.mp3]	I'll be back.

2247679	[sound:2247679.mp3]	I'll be quick.
1023210	[sound:1023210.mp3]	That can't be.
2007923	[sound:2007923.mp3]	Let's be safe.
282402	[sound:282402.mp3]	Don't be silly.
2387090	[sound:2387090.mp3]	I may be right.
1740523	[sound:1740523.mp3]	I may be wrong.
3724830	[sound:3724830.mp3]	I must be calm.
2247648	[sound:2247648.mp3]	I'd be careful.
2247648	[sound:2247648.mp3]	I'd be careful.
2247650	[sound:2247650.mp3]	I'd be grateful.
42096	[sound:42096.mp3]	It may be true.
2262206	[sound:2262206.mp3]	It must be Tom.
2248964	[sound:2248964.mp3]	It'll be funny.
2248972	[sound:2248972.mp3]	It'll be ready.

4397571	[sound:4397571.mp3]	That'd be cool.
3312953	[sound:3312953.mp3]	We may be late.
3731897	[sound:3731897.mp3]	Can I be honest?
2255340	[sound:2255340.mp3]	You'll be free.
2387211	[sound:2387211.mp3]	I might be back.
3178616	[sound:3178616.mp3]	It must be done.
3178613	[sound:3178613.mp3]	It must be hard.
302334	[sound:302334.mp3]	He is old.
371409	[sound:371409.mp3]	He is ill.
2203136	[sound:2203136.mp3]	Tom is OK.
2236731	[sound:2236731.mp3]	Tom is in.
2202600	[sound:2202600.mp3]	Tom is back.

2233711	[sound:2233711.mp3]	This is nice.
2233713	[sound:2233713.mp3]	This is nuts.
1349952	[sound:1349952.mp3]	It's me!
456175	[sound:456175.mp3]	It's 3:30.
2123583	[sound:2123583.mp3]	It's right.
2123579	[sound:2123579.mp3]	It's scary.
2203693	[sound:2203693.mp3]	What's good?
2549803	[sound:2549803.mp3]	What's next?
50984	[sound:50984.mp3]	Who's there?
2203308	[sound:2203308.mp3]	We're sad.
2242978	[sound:2242978.mp3]	They're fat.
2202690	[sound:2202690.mp3]	You're cool.
4368269	[sound:4368269.mp3]	You're very shy.
2242972	[sound:2242972.mp3]	They're children.
2243651	[sound:2243651.mp3]	They're not real.
433544	[sound:433544.mp3]	This is true.
392210	[sound:392210.mp3]	What is this?
2240332	[sound:2240332.mp3]	Where is Tom?
871554	[sound:871554.mp3]	Who is there?
2248736	[sound:2248736.mp3]	It isn't easy.
1868130	[sound:1868130.mp3]	Tom isn't dead.
2236959	[sound:2236959.mp3]	Tom isn't done.
2236968	[sound:2236968.mp3]	Tom isn't funny.
2549240	[sound:2549240.mp3]	Tom isn't hungry.
1862	[sound:1862.mp3]	It is raining.
311854	[sound:311854.mp3]	She is crying.
1476284	[sound:1476284.mp3]	She is talking.
1689909	[sound:1689909.mp3]	I do it because I have to.
6348166	[sound:6348166.mp3]	I can't do that, because I'm busy.
5055683	[sound:5055683.mp3]	I came because of Tom.
3618710	[sound:3618710.mp3]	Tom is here because of me.

6666325	[sound:6666325.mp3]	I got into trouble because of Tom.
388616	[sound:388616.mp3]	I do it because I want to.
2047593	[sound:2047593.mp3]	But I was careful.
887550	[sound:887550.mp3]	She was kissed by him.

260397	[sound:260397.mp3]	I agree with him.
2233691	[sound:2233691.mp3]	This is his.
2248917	[sound:2248917.mp3]	It wasn't his.

4853366	[sound:4853366.mp3]	It depends how I feel.
5809116	[sound:5809116.mp3]	It's not how it seems.
6080777	[sound:6080777.mp3]	Just how rich are you?

6049325	[sound:6049325.mp3]	Do you mind if I stay?
2323915	[sound:2323915.mp3]	I doubt if it'll snow.
3821804	[sound:3821804.mp3]	I wonder if Tom is OK.
6233170	[sound:6233170.mp3]	I wonder if Tom is up.
