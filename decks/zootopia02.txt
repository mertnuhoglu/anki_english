- Way to hustle, bud. I love you. <br> I owe you. <br> 
- Hurry! We gotta beat the rush hour and... <br> It's night?! <br> 
- Closed. <br> Great. <br> Mm. And I will betcha <br> you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm? <br> 
- Darn it. It's a bummer. <br> You wasted the day on purpose. <br> 
- Ma'am, I have a fake badge. I would never <br> impede your pretend investigation. <br> 
- It's not a pretend investigation! <br> 
- Look, see? See him? This otter is missing. <br> 
- Well, then they should have <br> gotten a real cop to find him. <br> 
- What is your problem? <br> 
- Does <br> seeing me fail somehow make <br> you feel better about your <br> own sad, miserable life? <br> 
- It does, 100%. <br> 
- Now, since you're sans warrant. <br> I guess we're done? <br> 
- Fine. We are done. <br> Here's your pen. <br> 
- First off, you throw like a bunny. <br> 
- Second, you're a very sore loser. <br> 
- See you later, Officer Fluff. <br> 
- So sad this is over. <br> 
- I wish I could have helped more. <br> 
- The thing is, you don't need... <br> a warrant if you have probable cause, <br> and I'm pretty sure I saw a... <br> shifty lowlife climbing the fence. <br> 
- So you're helping plenty! Come on! <br> 
- 2-9-T-H-D-0-3! <br> This is it! <br> 
- Polar bear fur. <br> 
- Oh my God! <br> What? What? <br> The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole! <br> 
- But on CD. <br> Who still uses CDs? <br> 
- Carrots, if your otter was here, <br> 
- Those are claw marks. <br> 
- You ever seen anything like this? <br> No. <br> 
- Oh, wait. Look! <br> 
- This is him. Emmitt Otterton. <br> 
- He was definitely here. <br> 
- What do you think happened? <br> 
- Oh no, wait a minute. <br> 
- Polar bear fur... <br> Rat-pack music. Fancy cup. <br> 
- I know whose car this is, we gotta go! <br> What? <br>
- Whose car is it? <br> 
- The most feared crime boss in Tundratown. <br> 
- They call him Mr. Big, and he does not <br> like me. So we gotta go! <br> 
- I'm not leaving, <br> this is a crime scene. <br> 
- Well, it's gonna be an <br> even bigger crime scene... <br> if Mr. Big finds me here, <br> so we're leaving right now. <br> 
- Raymond! And is that Kevin? <br> 
- Long time, no see. <br> 
- And speaking of no see, <br> how about you forget you saw me? <br> 
- Huh? <br> For old times sake? <br> 
- That's a no.. <br>
